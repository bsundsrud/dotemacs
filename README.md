# Spacemacs without Spacemacs

Emacs config meant to work for me, personally, while still looking good.  Faster to start up than spacemacs, but server mode and `emacsclient` is still recommended.

## Installation

1. `git clone git@github.com:bsundsrud/dotemacs.git ~/.emacs.d`
2. Start emacs
3. run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts RET`
4. restart emacs for pretty icons
